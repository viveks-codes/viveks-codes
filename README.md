                        		A computer programmer, sometimes called more recently a coder (especially in more informal contexts), is a
                        		person who creates computer software. The term computer programmer can refer to a specialist in one area of
                        		computers, or to a generalist who writes code for many kinds of software.
                        		A programmer's most oft-used computer language (e.g., Assembly, COBOL, C, C++, C#, JavaScript, Lisp, Python) may
                        		be prefixed to the term programmer. Some who work with web programming languages also prefix their titles with
                        		web. vivek codes
                        		A range of occupations that involve programming also often require a range of other, similar skills, for
                        		example: (software) developer, web developer, mobile applications developer, embedded firmware developer,
                        		software engineer, computer scientist, game programmer, game developer and software analyst. The use of the term
                        		programmer as applied to these positions is sometimes considered an insulting simplification or even derogatory.
                        		British countess and mathematician Ada Lovelace is often considered to be the first computer programmer, as she
                        		was the first to publish part of a program (specifically an algorithm) intended for implementation on Charles
                        		Babbage's analytical engine, in October 1842. The algorithm was used to calculate Bernoulli numbers.[7] Because
                        		Babbage's machine was never completed as a functioning standard in Lovelace's time, she unfortunately never had
                        		the opportunity to see the algorithm in action.
                        		The ENIAC programming team, consisting of Kay McNulty, Betty Jennings, Betty Snyder, Marlyn Wescoff, Fran Bilas
                        		and Ruth Lichterman were the first regularly working programmers.[8][9] International Programmers' Day is
                        		celebrated annually on 7 January.[10] In 2009, the government of Russia decreed a professional annual holiday
                        		known as Programmers' Day to be celebrated on 13 September (12 September in leap years). It had already been an
                        		unofficial holiday before that in many countries.
                        		The word software was used as early as 1953, but did not regularly appear in print until the 1960s.[11] Before
                        		this time, computers were programmed either by customers or the few commercial computer manufacturers of the
                        		time, such as UNIVAC and IBM. The first company founded to specifically provide software products and services
                        		was the Computer Usage Company, in 1955.[12]
                        		The software industry expanded in the early 1960s, almost immediately after computers were first sold in
                        		mass-produced quantities. Universities, governments and businesses created a demand for software. Many of these
                        		programs were written in-house by full-time staff programmers; some were distributed freely between users of a
                        		particular machine for no charge. And others were developed on a commercial basis. Other firms, such as Computer
                        		Sciences Corporation (founded in 1959) also started to grow. The computer/hardware manufacturers soon started
                        		bundling operating systems, system software and programming environments with their machines.[citation needed]
                        		The industry expanded greatly with the rise of the personal computer ("PC") in the mid-1970s, which brought
                        		computing to the average office worker. In the following years the PC also helped create a constantly-growing
                        		market for games, applications and utilities software. CP/M, later replaced by DOS, Microsoft's Windows popular
                        		operating system of the time.[13] portfolio vivek codes
                        		In the early years of the 21st century, another successful business model has arisen for hosted software, called
                        		software-as-a-service, or SaaS. From the point of view of producers of some proprietary software, SaaS reduces
                        		the concerns about unauthorized copying, since it can only be accessed through the Web, and by definition, no
                        		client software is loaded onto the end user's PC. SaaS is typically run out of the cloud.
                        		Computer programmers write, test, debug, and maintain the detailed instructions, called computer programs, that
                        		computers must follow to perform their functions. Programmers also conceive, design, and test logical structures
                        		for solving problems by computer. Many technical innovations in programming — advanced computing technologies
                        		and sophisticated new languages and programming tools — have redefined the role of a programmer and elevated
                        		much of the programming work done today. Job titles and descriptions may vary, depending on the organization.
                        		Programmers work in many settings, including corporate information technology ("IT") departments, big software
                        		companies, small service firms and government entities of all sizes. Many professional programmers also work for
                        		consulting companies at client sites as contractors. Licensing is not typically required to work as a
                        		programmer, although professional certifications are commonly held by programmers. Programming is widely
                        		considered a profession (although some[who?] authorities disagree on the grounds that only careers with legal
                        		licensing requirements count as a profession).
                        		Programmers' work varies widely depending on the type of business for which they are writing programs. For
                        		example, the instructions involved in updating financial records are very different from those required to
                        		duplicate conditions on an aircraft for pilots training in a flight simulator. Simple programs can be written in
                        		a few hours, more complex ones may require more than a year of work, while others are never considered
                        		'complete' but rather are continuously improved as long as they stay in use. In most cases, several programmers
                        		work together as a team under a senior programmer's supervision. portfolio
                        		A software engineer writing JavaScript portfolio vivek codes
                        		Programmers write programs according to the specifications determined primarily by more senior programmers and
                        		by systems analysts. After the design process is complete, it is the job of the programmer to convert that
                        		design into a logical series of instructions that the computer can follow. The programmer codes these
                        		instructions in one of many programming languages. Different programming languages are used depending on the
                        		purpose of the program. COBOL, for example, is commonly used for business applications that typically run on
                        		mainframe and midrange computers, whereas Fortran is used in science and engineering. C++ and Python are widely
                        		used for both scientific and business applications. Java, C#, JS and PHP are popular programming languages for
                        		Web and business applications. Programmers generally know more than one programming language and, because many
                        		languages are similar, they often can learn new languages relatively easily. In practice, programmers often are
                        		referred to by the language they know, e.g. as Java programmers, or by the type of function they perform or
                        		environment in which they work: for example, database programmers, mainframe programmers, or Web developers.
                        		When making changes to the source code that programs are made up of, programmers need to make other programmers
                        		aware of the task that the routine is to perform. They do this by inserting comments in the source code so that
                        		others can understand the program more easily and by documenting their code. To save work, programmers often use
                        		libraries of basic code that can be modified or customized for a specific application. This approach yields more
                        		reliable and consistent programs and increases programmers' productivity by eliminating some routine steps.
                        		Testing and debugging
                        		Programmers test a program by running it and looking for bugs (errors). As they are identified, the programmer
                        		usually makes the appropriate corrections, then rechecks the program until an acceptably low level and severity
                        		of bugs remain. This process is called testing and debugging. These are important parts of every programmer's
                        		job. Programmers may continue to fix these problems throughout the life of a program. Updating, repairing,
                        		modifying, and expanding existing programs is sometimes called maintenance programming. Programmers may
                        		contribute to user guides and online help, or they may work with technical writers to do such work.
                        		Application versus system programming
                        		Computer programmers often are grouped into two broad types: application programmers and systems programmers.
                        		Application programmers write programs to handle a specific job, such as a program to track inventory within an
                        		organization. They also may revise existing packaged software or customize generic applications which are
                        		frequently purchased from independent software vendors. Systems programmers, in contrast, write programs to
                        		maintain and control computer systems software, such as operating systems and database management systems. These
                        		workers make changes in the instructions that determine how the network, workstations, and CPU of the system
                        		handle the various jobs they have been given and how they communicate with peripheral equipment such as printers
                        		and disk drives. vivek codes
                        		Types of software portfolio
                        		Programmers in software development companies may work directly with experts from various fields to create
                        		software – either programs designed for specific clients or packaged software for general use – ranging from
                        		video games to educational software to programs for desktop publishing and financial planning. Programming of
                        		packaged software constitutes one of the most rapidly growing segments of the computer services industry. Some
                        		companies or organizations – even small ones – have set up their own IT team to ensure the design and
                        		development of in-house software to answer to very specific needs from their internal end-users, especially when
                        		existing software are not suitable or too expensive. This is for example the case in research
                        		laboratories.[citation needed]
                        		In some organizations, particularly small ones, people commonly known as programmer analysts are responsible for
                        		both the systems analysis and the actual programming work. The transition from a mainframe environment to one
                        		that is based primarily on personal computers (PCs) has blurred the once rigid distinction between the
                        		programmer and the user. Increasingly, adept end users are taking over many of the tasks previously performed by
                        		programmers. For example, the growing use of packaged software, such as spreadsheet and database management
                        		software packages, allows users to write simple programs to access data and perform calculations.[citation
                        		needed] vivek codes
